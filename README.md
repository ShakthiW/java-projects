## How to Run

This section provides instructions on how to run the Java project using both IntelliJ IDEA and the terminal.

## Running with IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.

2. Ensure you have configured the project correctly and set up any necessary build configurations.

3. Navigate to the main class of your Java project.

4. Right-click on the main class and select "Run <YourMainClass>" to run the project.

## Running with Terminal

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.

2. Compile your Java source files using `javac` command, for example:
   ```shell
   javac -d out src/*.java
   ```
3. Navigate to the output directory:
   ```shell
   cd out
   ```
4. Run your Java program using java command, specifying the main class:
   ```shell
   java <YourMainClass>
   ```
